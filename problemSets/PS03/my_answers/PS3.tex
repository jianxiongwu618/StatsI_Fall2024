\section*{Question 1}
\vspace{.25cm}
\noindent We are interested in knowing how the difference in campaign spending between incumbent and challenger affects the incumbent's vote share.

\section*{Question 4}
\noindent The residuals from part (a) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{voteshare} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger. The residuals in part (b) tell us how much of the variation in \texttt{presvote} is $not$ explained by the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger in the district.

\section*{Question 5}
\noindent What if the incumbent's vote share is affected by both the president's popularity and the difference in spending between incumbent and challenger? 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Run a regression where the outcome variable is the incumbent's \texttt{voteshare} and the explanatory variables are \texttt{difflog} and \texttt{presvote}.
		
		\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=125, lastline=127]{PS03_Jianxiong Wu_23354731.R} 
		
		\begin{verbatim} 
		Results: 
		Call:
		lm(formula = voteshare ~ difflog + presvote, data = inc.sub)
		
		Residuals:
		Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max 
		-0.25928 -0.04737 -0.00121  0.04618  0.33126 
		
		Coefficients:
		Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|)    
		(Intercept) 0.4486442  0.0063297   70.88   <2e-16 ***
		difflog     0.0355431  0.0009455   37.59   <2e-16 ***
		presvote    0.2568770  0.0117637   21.84   <2e-16 ***
		---
		Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
		
		Residual standard error: 0.07339 on 3190 degrees of freedom
		Multiple R-squared:  0.4496,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.4493 
		F-statistic:  1303 on 2 and 3190 DF,  p-value: < 2.2e-16
		
		
		This regression is a multivariate regression, with both difflog 
		and prevote as independent variables. On average, when difflog 
		is held constant, each unit increase in prevote increases the 
		incumbent's vote share by approximately 0.2569. When prevote 
		is held constant, each unit increase in difflog increases the 
		incumbent's vote share increases by approximately 0.0355. 
		Both explanatory variables have a significant positive effect on 
		the incumbent's vote share.
		\end{verbatim}
\newpage	
		\item Write the prediction equation.
		
		\begin{verbatim} 
		Results: 
		voteshare = intercept + coefficient1 * difflog + coefficient2 * presvote
		voteshare = 0.448644 + 0.035543 * difflog + 0.256887 * presvote
		\end{verbatim}
		
		\item What is it in this output that is identical to the output in Question 4? Why do you think this is the case?
		
		\begin{verbatim} 
		Results: 
		The coefficient of presvote in the q5_regression in Question 5 is the 
		same as the coefficient of q2_residuals in the q4_regression in 
		Question 4, which is 0.2569. The reason for this is that in the 
		q5_regression, difflog is used as an explanatory variable along with 
		presvote. And in q4_regression, the residuals of voteshare ~ difflog 
		and presvote ~ difflog are used for the regression. So there is an 
		independent effect of presvote on vote share after controlling for 
		difflog.
